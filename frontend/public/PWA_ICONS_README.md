# PWA Icons

This directory should contain PWA icon files:
- `icon-192.png` - 192x192 pixels
- `icon-512.png` - 512x512 pixels

These icons are referenced in `manifest.json`. You can generate these from your app logo/branding.

The PWA will work without these icons, but won't have custom icons when installed to home screens.
